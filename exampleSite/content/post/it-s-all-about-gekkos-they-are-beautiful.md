**Lizardmen** are reptilian humanoids that inhabit the [Kebos Lowlands](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Kebos_Lowlands "Kebos Lowlands") and within the [Lizardman Canyon](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Lizardman_Canyon "Lizardman Canyon"). Secretly created from [a native species of lizard](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Lizard_(Quidamortem) "Lizard (Quidamortem)") during the 37th decade _(1,040 years ago)_ under the rule of King Shayzien VII, he had intended the lizardmen to become his personal army to enforce his tyrannical rule of Great Kourend. After he returned from the dead as [Xeric](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Xeric "Xeric"), the lizardmen continued to serve him loyally, seeing him as their god. Today, long after his exile, they still remain loyal, constantly attempting to invade Great Kourend.
